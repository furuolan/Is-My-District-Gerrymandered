## Algorithms for Measuring Geographic Compactness

* Roeck
Find the smallest circle containing the district and take the ratio of the district area to that of a circle. This ratio is always between 0 and 1; the closer it is to 1, the more compact is the district.
* Convex Hull
* Polsby-Popper
* Boyce-Clark
Determine the center of gravity of the district and measure the distance from the center to the outside edges
* Length/Width
Find a rectangle enclosing the district and touching it on all four sides, such that the ratio of the length to the width is a maximum. The closer the ratio is to 1, the more compact is the district.
